          Climate Smart Cities: Grenada is an initiative of the Government of Grenada in collaboration with the NYU Marron Institute of Urban Management, which seeks to enhance the resilience of Grenadians to climate change and extreme events through a multi-disciplinary capacity-building methodology that includes workshops, engagements, and partnerships with both the public and private sector. Through nine projects that address different aspects of long-term climate change resilience and adaptation, Climate Smart Cities: Grenada hopes to offer a prototype for other Caribbean and island countries so that the Caribbean can become the world’s first climate smart zone.

          This initiative is commissioned by the Green Climate Fund (GCF), a $100 billion international fund created to assist developing countries in mitigating and adapting to climate change and reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. GCF was set up in 2010 and uses public investment to foster finance of the private sector and open markets to new investments.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Marron Institute of Urban Management conducts innovative applied research, working with cities to take on critical challenges of urban living. By bringing together international experts on climate change resilience with Grenadian policymakers and civil society through numerous workshops and engagements, Marron assists Grenadians in developing policy frameworks, knowledge management platforms, and response and adaptation tools to effectively address the challenges of climate change in their country.

        <p>
          Grenada is a small island developing state (SIDS), located in the Southern Caribbean, south of the Windward Islands and 100 miles north of Venezuela. The island is  approximately 21 miles (34 km) long and 12 miles (19 km) wide. The capital, St. George’s, on the southwest coast, is also the main port, and contains the waterfront known as the Carenage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grenada became independent within the Commonwealth of Nations in 1974, and its main economic activities are agriculture and tourism. The majority of the land is forest or cropland.

          Overall, the country is extremely vulnerable to climate change and is already experiencing many of its effects such as flooding, the degradation of the environment, and more extreme weather. Although the country relies on imported fossil fuels for energy production and transportation, action is being taken to explore alternatives that are more sustainable and can contribute to protecting its natural resources and cultural heritage.

          The Green Climate Fund (GCF) supports the efforts of developing countries to respond to the challenge of climate change by limiting or reducing their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and implementing mechanisms of adaptation. The Fund takes special consideration of the needs of nations that are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, as is the case of Small Island Developing States (SIDS).
        </p>
        <p>
          GCF seeks to use public investment to stimulate private finance and investment in low-emission and climate-resilient development, representing a paradigm shift in the global response to climate change. It was created in 2010 by 194 countries under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In 2015, the Green Climate Fund took on a key role in implementing the Paris Agreement and supporting the goal of keeping climate change below 2 degrees Celsius, and since then strives to invest equally in mitigation and adaptation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The funds come mainly from developed countries, but also from developing countries and cities like Paris. The financial products offered include grants, concessional loans, subordinated debt, equity, and guarantees. GCF’s activities rest on the principle of country ownership, and works by offering funds directly to national and sub-national organizations, rather than using international intermediaries. The National Designated Authority that is appointed in each country liases between the government and CGF and approves all the projects to ensure they are aligned with national priorities.
